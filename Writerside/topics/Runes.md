# Runes

Runes are symbols that you use in .svelte and .svelte.js / .svelte.ts files to control the Svelte compiler. If you think of Svelte as a language, runes are part of the syntax â€” they are keywords.

Runes have a $ prefix and look like functions

## $state


## $derived


## $effect


## $props


## $bindable


## $inspect


## $host
