# Proportions

A ratio is another word for a fraction

A proportion is two equal ratios

```
2/4 = 5/10
```

With proportions, we can cross-multiply

```
2*10 = 4*5
```

We can use this property with variables

```
3/6 = x/4

# Proportion
12 = 6x
x = 12/6
x = 2
```

If a numerator is zero, the other numerator has to ve zero in order to work
